# Machine learning approach to Fe-based soft magnetic nanocrystalline materials design

## Regression Analysis and Optimization
In this notebook, the flollowing tasks are performed:
* exploratory-data-analysis (EDA), feature engineering. 
* Hypothesis testing for linear regression.
* Distribution transformation.
* Feature selection using LASSO.
* Regression model using linear regression.
* Optimizing magnetic property based on regression models by changing material processing conditions.
