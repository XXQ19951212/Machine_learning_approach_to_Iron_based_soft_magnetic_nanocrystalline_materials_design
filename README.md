# Machine learning approach to Fe-based soft magnetic nanocrystalline materials design

## Feature Selection and Machine Learning exploration
In the Feature selection and Data Visualization folder, the following tasks are carried out:
* Feature selection using feature importance of Gradient Boost Trees.
* Compare model performance of Random Forest, kNN, Decision Tree, Simple fead forward Neural Network, SVM and Linear Regression. 
* Evaluate model accuracy using 20-fold cross validation on Magnetic Saturation, Magnetostriction and Coercivity.




## Regression Analysis and Optimization
In this notebook, the flollowing tasks are performed:
* exploratory-data-analysis (EDA), feature engineering. 
* Hypothesis testing for linear regression.
* Distribution transformation.
* Feature selection using LASSO.
* Regression model using linear regression.
* Optimizing magnetic property based on regression models by changing material processing conditions.
